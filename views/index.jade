            p Sites such as <a href="#">The Times Crossword</a>, <a href="#">OpenPhoto</a> and <a href="#">Voost</a> use Persona instead of usernames to sign you in.
            p This means you only need one password to sign in to many sites.

          h1 Persona preserves your privacy
          p Persona does not track your activity around the Web. It creates a wall between signing you in and what you do once you’re there. The history of what sites you visit is stored only on your own computer.
